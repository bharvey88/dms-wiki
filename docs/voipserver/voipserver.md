### Phones

More than 75 VoIP phones were donated to the Dallas Makerspace from an upgrade of a local call center. Most of the phones were in very good shape.

The Siemens OpenStage 40 VoIP SIP Phones have a built in two port Ethernet switch and can be powered with PoE or a standalone 48v power supply. They have a nice LCD display and 6 programmable buttons. The LCD can display a 144x32 pixel b&w .bmp logo.
