## Summary

This page is a quick outline of various embedded linux computers, pricing, specifications, differences, etc. This is meant primarily for comparison purposes and to allow viewers to get an idea of what the differences are in this increasingly crowded market. Project links made with each device are welcome. This list is by no means comprehensive. This page is specifically for boards that can run Linux or Android (not straight Arduinos, etc.)
