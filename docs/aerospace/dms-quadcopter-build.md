## Intro

Welcome to the DMS/NTDUG group build of a multicopter based on the DJI F450 Airframe. It is updated as issues arise. Please Email at "espana.romeo" AT "gmail Dot com" if there are issues that need to be corrected. Updated 2/22/2014

To All,

This is free build class for a technical and complicated application, so please be prepared to hack, repair, improvise, innovate and research every step of the way. Understand that there is no class out there that can completely cover all of the information available on the subject (much less in 6 hours), so soak up as much as you can, where-ever you can (Online, in class,and during meetups.)

My fellow instructors and I are here to help you avoid the pitfalls we ourselves have fallen into, and in turn hope you will pass that along to others.

-Romeo España
