Docker Swarm is a clustering and scheduling tool for Docker containers. With Swarm, IT administrators and developers can establish and manage a cluster of Docker nodes as a single virtual system

### Intro

In order to make our systems more resilient and gearing up for fully automated deployment and testing pipelines for prod/preprod services the following highlights general details on the DMS docker cloud.

## Operations

Our docker cloud servers are managed though CICD and access able with a web ui known as Portainer which is authenticated against our active directory credentials.

A user needs to be apart of either `Portainer Admins` for docker cloud administrators or `Portainer Users` for general cloud users.

This gives them authentication permissions but does not grant access permissions within portainer. For that one needs to ask their committee chair to login into <https://communitygrid.dms.local/> then visit users and add the new users by username into their committee’s team.
