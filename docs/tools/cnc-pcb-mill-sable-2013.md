### Homing Switches

- According to the tinyg manual, should use NC homing switches for better noise immunity

### Power Supply

There are two power supplies, one for the CNC control and one for the spindle; one is 24VDC for the TinyG and servos, the other is 100VDC for the spindle. The spindle supply is not well documented but assumed to be adequate for the ~500W spindle. It has a variable output controlled by a potentiometer. The CNC control power supply is marked as 24V @ 15A.

- CNC Control Fuse Rating Calculation
  - Output Power: 24V @ 15 Amps = 360 Watts
  - Current at minimum input voltage: 360W / 100V = 3.6A input max
  - AC Fuse Rating: 3.6A + 20% = 4.32A Fuse

Note: This is not the nominal input current which should be substantially less. This is also not the \_peak\_ input current which could be substantially higher when charging the input caps. This is the fuse rating which is designed so the fuse will not trip under the full operating range of expected input voltage (100-130V), maximum output power, fuse tolerances, and ambient temperature (20% factor).

- Spindle Fuse Rating Calculation
  - Output Power: 500 Watts
  - Current at minimum input voltage: 500 W / 100V = 5.0A input max
  - AC Fuse Rating: 5.0A + 20% = 6A Fuse

### Spindle

- The spindle has a separate fuse on the DC supply to protect from damage during a spindle stall
- 100VDC / 500W
- Air cooled, Brush contact armature
- 12,000 RPM
- 52mm diameter
- 2KG

## Software

- Convert gerber to gcode

[FlatCAM](http://flatcam.org/): Free and Open-source PCB CAM

- G-code runner for mill control

[Chilipeppr](https://github.com/synthetos/TinyG/wiki/Chilipeppr): Mill control with PCB auto-level

[bCNC](https://github.com/vlachoudis/bCNC): GRBL CNC command sender, auto-level, and g-code editor
