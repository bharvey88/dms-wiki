We need a fileserver (among other things) located at the space in order to facilitate working on and sharing files. This page will act as a design document for the services and setup of a proposed fileserver.

## Directories

| Directory               | Permissions | Description                        |

## Services

All authentication will be handled by LDAP.

### SSH

- Authenticated access to /home/username

### HTTP

- <http://servername/public> for /var/public with directory listing
- <http://servername/~username> for /home/username/htdocs
- Can we use [MPM-ITK](http://mpm-itk.sesse.net/) to run each vhost under the user's UID?

### MySQL

All users have full permissions to username-% and ability to create DBs

### SMB/Samba

## Hardware

Andrew LeCody has donated a 1u Supermicro server with a hardware raid card and bays for 4 hot-swapable SATA drives. If all 4 bays are used, we can setup a RAID 5 or RAID 10.
