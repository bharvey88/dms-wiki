## Linux and Mac via wine

Some users have reported success with [Wine based solutions](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=28792).

Linux: Ubuntu 10.10 with Wine 1.3.34 (﻿﻿1.3.37 works too) runs Artemis 1.55 as a server, NOTE this requires a non-default apt repository, see <http://www.winehq.org/download/ubuntu> for more information. Wine 1.2.2 does not work.

Mac OSX can use Wineskin.

## Mobile to Desktop Intraplay

Artemis 2.0 has been ported to iOS and Android and is available in the App Store and Google Play Store, respectively. Beware that several copies on playstore may older builds. Besure to have the latest version of 2.0 to play.
