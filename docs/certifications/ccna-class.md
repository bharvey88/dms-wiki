## CCNA Class

Charles & Rich Hill will teach the entire Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) exam \#200-120 topics in an accelerated 12 week format.

Cost: free. Open to members & non-members Classes run from January 6TH to March 24TH, 2014

The class starts with the most basic of basic concepts of how networks work and how to operate them. 1 hour lecture and a 30 minute lab or simulation/demonstration each week.

### CCNA Overview Course Outline

OR "60 Hours of Material in Roughly 24 Hours"

**Week 1: Building a Simple Network**

- Mission: Making one box of electronics talk to another
- Network components: switches, bridges, hubs, wireless access points, routers, and firewalls
- OSI model vs. TCP/IP
- Network addressing and encapsulation, "datagram, frame, or packet?"
- Types of cables and connectors and layer 1 caveats
- Routing versus switching, label switching, load balancing
- Connecting to a switch/router console port
- Cisco switch password recovery procedure
- Configuration first steps
- Basic utilities: telnet, ssh, ping, arp, traceroute, etc.

**Week 2: Switching basics OR "Just Enough to be Dangerous"**

- Ethernet 802.3
- Ethernet media types and connectors
- Crossover cables versus MDIX
- 802.3u, Clauses 28 & 40, autonegotiate, ugly patents, and two minutes of hate
- MAC address table / CAM
- Broadcasts and broadcast domains
- VLANs
- Configuring Cisco switch interfaces
