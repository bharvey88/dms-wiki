## Overview

The service was put into production on 1/18/2016 and is supported by the [Infrastructure Committee](https://dallasmakerspace.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Committee). It runs on Ignite's (open source) OpenFire server with the Jitsi plugin.

## Instant Messaging

While you can use any [XMPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP) client, Spark is the only client that the Infrastructure Committee will support. It can be downloaded from [HERE](http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/spark/).

### Web-Based Client

The web version can be accessed at <https://dallasmakerspace.org/im/>

### Full Client Setup

1.  Open Spark
2.  Enter your [DMS Active Directory account](how-to-enable-your-active-directory-login.md) username

4.  Enter "im.dallasmakerspace.org" for the server
5.  Select "Save password" and "Auto login" (if desired)

### Adding Other Members

2.  Click there and type in someone's name, username, or email address
3.  Hit enter
4.  A new window will appear with a listing of users that were found.
    1.  NOTE: If searching by name, you must enter their first name first. You cannot search by last name at this time.
    2.  NOTE: If the person does not appear in the search results, but you know they're a member, they probably have not created their Active Directory account.

## Video Conferencing
