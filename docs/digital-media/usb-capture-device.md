A helpful comment on the intertron was: (actually, [here](http://www.amazon.com/Channel-DVR-Video-Capture-Audio/dp/B002BCKYHY))

Works for me on Linux (Debian 6.0 Squeeze), but not nslu2 (not enough memory \[256Mb\] or cpu power \[BogoMIPS=266.24\] to do this AND 'motion'), but it work did on a SheevaPlug (512M and BogoMIPS=1192.75) and better systems sufficient for security cameras.

Search for "easycap_dc60.0.9.tar.gz" ( I found it at sites google com /site/viewandrecordwithlinux/file-cabinet/easycap_dc60.0.9.tar.gz ) and more or less follow the embedded README. (With the addition of: sudo rmmod easycap && sudo modprobe easycap 'bars=0').

Change /etc/motion/motion.conf settings: videodevice /dev/easycap1, v4l2_palette 5, input 1, norm 1 . The /dev/easycap might be 0 or 1; input is 1, 2, 3, or 4 (because there are 4 cables).

I was not interested in the audio port and so didn't test/use it.

This may very well be [the code they were talking about, above](http://code.google.com/p/easycap-somagic-linux/). However it doesn't seem to have the same idVendor.

This [blog](http://easycap.blogspot.com/2012/07/new-driver-for-easycap-dc60-stk1160.html) may be relevant though.

Current source for the driver is located

root@fileserver:/usr/src/linux-source-3.2.0/linux-source-3.2.0/drivers/staging/media/easycap

More information, potentially relevant:

<http://linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Easycap>

<http://linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Stk1160>

"The stk1160 driver is the successor of the easycap driver. It supports video capturing and audio capturing via ALSA. This driver doesn't suffer from the limitations of the easycap driver. The stk1160 module replaces the easycap module in the 3.7 kernel release."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The easycap driver is out-of-date:

<https://github.com/ezequielgarcia/stk1160-standalone/issues/14>

    Everyone:

    I'm happy to report this is fixed (or almost fixed) in mainline. Expect a fix in v3.11 kernel and request a backport
    to your distribution's maintainer.

    This issue was NOT a BUG and had nothing at all to do with stk1160 driver. Instead it was simply the saa7115
    decoder driver not supporting gm7113c (chinese clone chip). This support has been added and as I said
    will be available probably in v3.11 kernel.

    I'm finally closing this!

From the kernel dev mailing list.

This may be the posting that will fix it: <https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/4/25/470>

This might be the actual patch: <https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/2493981/>

Also possibly relevant: <https://github.com/btrask/EasyCapViewer/tree/master/Documentation>

Have to follow this guide to make a new module on the fileserver: <http://www.codewhirl.com/2012/04/how-to-compile-a-single-module-in-ubuntu-linux/>
