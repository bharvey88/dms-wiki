20100623 Finished installing ConfirmAccount plugin. This required wget'ing a TRUNK version of ConfirmEdit, un-tar'ing this into a temp folder, moving the ConfirmEdit\* files into the extensions/recaptcha directory! I don't think a TRUNK version of ConfirmAccount is neccessary (as is alluded to [here](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension_talk:ConfirmAccount#.22efCheckIfAccountNameIsPending_failed_to_return_a_value.3B_.22)) The deal is that ConfirmAccount can use the Recaptcha plugin. However, the Recaptcha plugin includes a \*COPY\* of the ConfirmEdit plugin to do its work, and the ConfirmEdit plugin has been updated since the COPY was added to Recaptcha, so you have to update that manually.

20100624 Added [Flickr](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Flickr) extension. [PeterS](https://dallasmakerspace.org/wiki/User:PeterS)

20100802 Upgraded to MediaWiki v1.16.0. [PeterS](https://dallasmakerspace.org/wiki/User:PeterS)

20100803 Reshuffled the blog and wiki locations so that the default root is the blog, with the wiki living elsewhere. The wiki links didn't change so we dont' lose our Google PageRank.

Details:

    actual file system on server

    ~/dallasmakerspace.com/
    ~/dallasmakerspace.com/wiki/
    ~/dallasmakerspace.com/blog/

    Current "web directory" (in DH panel)
    /home/username/dallasmakerspace.com

    Current sub-directory rewrites
    -none-

    Goals:

    1. www.dallasmakerspace.com drops you at the blog
    2. the wiki lives ???? and works too :)
    3. human readable wiki URLs
    4. retain google page rank by having URLs not change

    Implemented setup:
    1. htaccess in / to redirect from / to /blog meets goal #1 (above)
    2. wiki lives in www.dms.com/w/
    - alter LocalSettings.php, $wgScriptPath =""; to be $wgScriptPath = "/wiki";
    - alter $wgArticlePath setting to be $wgArticlePath = "/wiki/$1";
    - alter $wgUsePathInfo to be $wgUsePathInfo = true;
    - alter $wgLogo to be $wgLogo = "/w/images/b/b7/Logo01.png";
    3. htaccess in / to redirect from /wiki to /w/ parts meets goal #2 and #3
    4. htaccess in /w/ to redirect from /wiki to /w/ parts also meets goal #2 and #3
