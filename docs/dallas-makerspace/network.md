## Network Hardware

### Core Switch

Our core switch consists of 4 Cisco Catalyst WS-3750G-48PS, configured with StackWise to act as one. The individual segments are Gi1... Gi4, each is a 48-port gigabit ethernet switch with all ports capable of PoE.

|            |                         |
|------------|-------------------------|
| **IP**     | 192.168.0.2             |
| **Access** | SSH                     |
| **Login**  | Available on admin wiki |

Ports on this switch stack should have a description set as specific as possible. Default is vlan info (e.g. "vlan2-member"), next best is device type (e.g. "wirelessap"), best is device name/location (e.g. "cam-lobby").

### Core Router

Our core router is a pfSense X-1540.

|            |                                                    |

### MakerManager/Access Control

[MakerManager](https://dallasmakerspace.org/makermanager) handles activating and deactivating RFID tags. It accomplishes this by connecting to a server at the space, which is running a script to configure the 3rd party access control system.

|                           |              |
|---------------------------|--------------|
| **MakerManager API IP**   | 192.168.0.48 |
| **Access Control IP**     | 192.168.0.49 |
| **Access Control \#2 IP** | 192.168.0.47 |

The 2nd access controller is not managed by MakerManager.

### BlueIris
