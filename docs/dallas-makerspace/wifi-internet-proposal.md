# Wifi Internet Proposal

The primary goal of this project is to provide the Dallas Makerspace with an Internet connection of at least 20Mbps. There is a datacenter 4.3 miles south of the space that has agreed to let us place networking gear on their roof for this project.

Secondary goals are:

- Increased throughput: 100Mbps would be preferred, up to 1Gbps may be possible with some designs.
- Decreased latency: Latency should be as low as possible, our current connection is 50-100ms to servers hosted in the Dallas area.
- Resiliency to power failure

## Why?

We currently have a 1.54mbit down and 512kbit AT&T DSL connection that has very bad latency and jitter.

As you can plainly see the DSL connection is very poor. This is exacerbated by the security cameras installed at DMS.

## Locations

- Location of DMS
  - [32.879486, -96.878732](http://g.co/maps/eqsd8)
- Location of datacenter
  - [32.817564, -96.873087](http://g.co/maps/a648y)

Connectivity at the datacenter will likely be a 100 Mbps ethernet drop, with a handful of public IPs available for our use.

## How Can I Help?

If we could get temporary access to two mobile/crank-up/push-up masts that would allow us to test if direct line of sight is available. Please contact Andrew LeCody for more info.
