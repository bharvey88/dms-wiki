I've tested the Chinese motors and the Ultimachine motors and they both work great. - Paul

I've not tested motors from Phidgets, but they may also work: [Phidgets](http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?category=23&product_id=3303) = \$70.00 + shipping

Note: The Ultimachine motors come with connectors attached, so you don't have to crimp your own connectors. The connectors are just 4 pin .1" header connectors.

### Pulleys and Belts

|  |  |  |  |  |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| **Item** | **Part \#** | **Source** | **Qty Required** | **unit price** |
| GT2 Pulley | A 6D51M015DF0605 | [SDP-SI](https://sdp-si.com/eStore/PartDetail.asp?Opener=Group&PartID=60189&GroupID=346) | 2 | \$18.51 |
| GT2 Belt (2218.00 mm) | A 6R51MB09060 | [SDP-SI](https://sdp-si.com/eStore/PartDetail.asp?Opener=Group&PartID=75964&GroupID=342) | 1 | \$11.95 |
| GT2 Belt (1 foot or 304.8mm) | 7959K21 | [McMaster Carr](http://www.mcmaster.com/#catalog/119/1053/=lxo5ao) | 8 | \$2.04 |
| GT2 Pulley (16 teeth) | 1375K35 | [McMaster Carr](http://www.mcmaster.com/#timing-belt-pulleys/=lxo3ft) | 2 | \$10.18 |

Note: Metal pulleys are not necessary, but it seems like finding plastic pulleys with less than a .9" inch (required for Y axis) diameter is difficult. The small tooth count and fine pitch should mean higher resolution than the standard MXL belts.

### Hobbed Bolt

### Threaded/Smooth Rod

The smooth rod needs to be M8 (for the LM8UU bushings), but the threaded rod can be 5/16ths or M8. Paul Brown has lots of 5/16ths rod and enough M8 drill rod for 2-3 printers. There is a chop saw at the space for cutting these. These rod lengths are for this print bed: [Lasercut Print Bed](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:17498)

Cut Lengths:

| Smooth                 | 332mm      | 2       | X axis for 270mm apart bases |
| Smooth                 | 250mm      | 2       | Z axis, can be longer        |
| Threaded               | 200mm      | 2       | Leadscrews, can be longer    |
| Threaded               | 305mm      | 4       | Bases 270mm apart            |

### Print Bed

Paul Brown made a design for this, but it is too large for our lasercutter: [Thingiverse Link](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:17498)

Ponoko.com will cut it for ~\$15. CNC'ing this part would be preferred.

Cut this part from 1/4" tempered hardboard from Home Depot. (pick the flattest piece you can find)

### Heated Bed

Initially, we will not be using a heated bed. PLA plastic prints well without a heated bed (not ABS though). PLA sticks to Lexan very well, so a Lexan sheet will work for the print bed.

Paul Brown ordered several large PCB's on 3/15/11 and is hoping to mill them into heated beds. They will be very cheap, around ~\$15.

Mike C has made a couple of heated beds using Prototyping Stripboard wired up as a large resistor [Thingiverse Inspiration](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12727). Seems to work well - heats faster than a commercial bed and costs \< \$6 for an 8" X 8" bed. Using two 4" X 8" clad copper boards (not electroplated) from Veroboard (ordered through Amazon.com) is a good, cheap source. Andrew Falgout improved on the soldering technique by using stripped Cat 5 wire as a bridge across the end holes to aid in soldering without increasing the thickness of the solder joint.

Note: Glass will need to be placed on the heated bed. This can be 1/8th inch glass cut at a local glass store to 8.5"x8.5". It should only be a few dollars per piece. Cork sheet under the hot bed will improve efficiency.

### Plastic Filament

Paul Brown is currently trying to arrange a group buy. Filament prices have recently increased from ~\$60 for 5lbs to ~\$100. We might still be able to get it for ~\$10 per lb.
